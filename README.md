## Introduction

The goal of the GNPyWrapper.jl is to increase the programmabilty of the already existing [GNPy Package](https://gnpy.readthedocs.io/en/master/) ([github page](https://github.com/Telecominfraproject/oopt-gnpy), [pip page](https://pypi.org/project/gnpy/)).

It is mainly written in [Julia](https://julialang.org/) because this language has some advantages. For example speed.

The work was inspired by the *gnpy-transmission-example* provided by the developers of GNPy.

The idea of the GNPyWrapper.jl is to only use the core functionalities of the [GNPy Package](https://gnpy.readthedocs.io/en/master/). This is done by:

- Getting rid of:


    - the automatic initialization step of the provided *gnpy-transmission-example*
    
    - and thereby getting rid of json data format and merging process


- Providing:

    - network element example descriptions in "native" Julia language 

        - which were created from *gnpy-transmission-example* with json-data
    
    - from which you can generate gnpy objects and vice versa

        - ATTENTION: RIGHT NOW: no roadm and fused  possible (and raman fiber)

        - ATTENTION: RIGHT NOW: only initialization of objects supported, not results (after propagating a signal through element)

    - a half-automatic process from which you can generate element and path descriptions

        - ATTENTION: RIGHT NOW: function for that not provided

    - two examples

        1. "example_01.jl"
        2. -not provided yet-

### Advantages

- interface from Julia to Python for GNPy Package and vice versa

- full control over gnpy elements

- also, better "understanding" of what is going on in the core of GNPy




### Disadvantages

right now:

- less automation


## Installation and Initialization of GNPyWrapper.jl

1. git clone this repo from ...
2. run julia
3. activate the GNPyWrapper.jl
4. install julia specifc packages 

    1. CondaPkg

        > add CondaPkg
    
    2. PythonCall
        
        > add PythonCall

5. install GNPy from pip

    > conda pip_add gnpy






## Examples

First example

- Set up:

    - you need to copy *cli_example_02* and paste it in the correct folder of GNPy (gnpy.core.tools) next to *cli_example*

- From Julia run:

    > include("example_01.jl")

## Additional information

Since the GNPyWrapper.jl was developed in two stages:

1. Testing the Wrapper ideas with a GNPyWrapper written in Python (Proof of Concept)
2. Implementing those ideas in the GNPyWrapper.jl in Julia

maybe in the future there will also launch an usable GNPyWrapper written in Python.
